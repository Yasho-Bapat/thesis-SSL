# gittuf implementation
GMeet; Aug 8th, 9:00 pm IST.

* Says he'll call me Yasho :p

* Works with aditya on gittuf mainly

## about gittuf
* not a canonical implementation of tuf
* draws from the ideas from tuf; eg - snapshots doesn't exist
* check out TAF
* Git does not provide any access control apart from user X can push to the repo
  * You can do whatever you want
  * There is no access control list
* gittuf is essentially getting access control to opensource git (the actual stuff, not github)
* [check out](github.com/gittuf/demo) -> PR by patrick
* its not a firewall; it's like an audit
  * verify after the fact


## TAF
* authenticating a repository
* i have a law, lawyers make changes; how do i ensure that only authorized ppl changed it
