# Questions on gittuf code

### To ask Jamal
1. In the `Push` command, should we be verifying if any policy is violated before pushing or committing?
2. Why is there no `commit` command
3. Cleanup
   4. Argument handling in main.go
   5. make cmd.go more gittuf indepenedent - more standalone

### To ask Patrick
1. What was the blob stuff aditya was saying about putting in the targets metadata? 
2. If I specifically pull a git hook from .git/hooks, will it work? 
3. I understand how the targets and when metadata is created, but how exactly is it used to verify stuff?
